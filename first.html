                <b>FIRST</b> stands for <i>For Inspiration and Recognition of
                Science and Technology</i>. Founded by Dean Kamen, it is considered
                by him as his greatest creation. FIRST is an organization that
                promotes <b>STEM</b> (Science, Technology, Engineering,
                Mathematics) to students all around the world by inspiring
                them to design and build robots for a competition. <b>FIRST</b>
                hosts four competitions:
                <b>Jr. FLL</b>, <b>FLL</b>, <b>FTC</b>, and <b>FRC</b>.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC, is a
                high school level competition originally designed to help
                bridge FIRST Lego League and FIRST Robotics Competition,
                allowing students to go from Legos to high level robotics more
                smoothly. But now, FTC has become its own competition. Building
                one and a half cube feet of robot is not as easy as it sounds.
                In September, teams all around the world pick up the game manual
                and start working. Given a set list of parts, teams are limited
                to using only certain materials for their robot, making the
                game harder and more challenging. Fitting mechanisms into the
                18' cube isn't easy, but this is what thousands and thousands of
                high school teams do from September to March, in order to
                compete in one of the best competitions in the world, FIRST
                Tech Challenge.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FIRST Robotics Competition, or FRC,
                is the first of the four FIRST competitions. It is a high school
                level competition, with the original purpose of inspiring a new
                generation of engineers and makers to build a better future.
                Every year, the game is released in January on Kickoff Day. Kickoff
                Day begins the 6 week journey that every FRC team must take, starting
                with a kit of parts, and ending with a competition capable robot.
