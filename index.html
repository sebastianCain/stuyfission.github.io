                  I've always loved engineering, and I currently base my entire life
                  around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team for 2 years,
                  I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams in the last two
                  years,
                  and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional teams this coming year. I also
                  build things on my free time, for myself and others. The amount of
                  time, money, and effort I have put into engineering is astronomical
                  compared to the time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest
                  drive to continue working towards my engineering goals is that
                  someday, I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community.
                  The feeling you get when you make something all by yourself, or
                  design something that works is the best feeling in the world, and
                  I want to share that with as many people as I can. When I was
                  younger, I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside
                  of arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities
                  that I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and
                  programming.

                  I joined robotics because of an interest in computer programmers
                  as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the difficulties
                  that robotics would present. From a young age, I've been extremely
                  interested in the workings of computers and I enjoy tinkering with
                  code in my free time. I enjoy the logical challenges presented by
                  code and the engineering challenges presented by robotics. I have
                  experience with object oriented coding languages and web design
                  and I have interned at an education company as a programmer. My
                  other hobbies aside from robotics include playing basketball,
                  League of Legends, piano, and guitar. As head of programming for
                  Stuy Fission 310, I am tasked with website design and maintenance
                  as well as robot programming and delegating programmers to do the
                  same.

                  The first time I got involved with robotics was when I went to a
                  robotics camp at Johns Hopkins&#39; Center for Talented Youth with
                  Alvin. I fell in love with robotics and as soon as I returned home
                  from the camp, I bought my own Lego Mindstorms kit. In middle
                  school, Alvin and I joined the robotics team and ended up leading
                  the team. I also started to make my own money by selling, bracelets,
                  and rubikâ€™s cubes to my classmates. Through that experience, I
                  learned to earn and manage my money. I hope to study at Harvard
                  business school. My combined experience in robotics and with money
                  led me to doing marketing for 310 Fission. My other interests
                  include chess, tennis, violin, basketball, and gaming.

                  considered
                  by him as his greatest creation. FIRST is an organization that
                  promotes <b>STEM</b> (Science, Technology, Engineering,
                  Mathematics) to students all around the world by inspiring
                  them to design and build robots for a competition.
                  <b>FIRST</b>
                  hosts four competitions:
                  <b>Jr. FLL</b>, <b>FLL</b>, <b>FTC</b>, and <b>FRC</b>.

                  FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC,
                  is a high school level competition created to inspire
                  young minds around the world to design and build robots
                  that will compete against other robots to complete a
                  challenge.
                  In September, teams worldwide are given a challenge that
                  their robot must complete. The teams must use a set list
                  of materials to build a robot to complete that challenge.
