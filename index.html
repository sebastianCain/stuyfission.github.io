              promotes <b>STEM</b> (Science, Technology, Engineering,
              Mathematics) to students all around the world by inspiring
              them to design and build robots for a competition. <b>FIRST</b>

              FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC,
              is a high school level competition created to inspire
              young minds around the world to design and build robots
              that will compete against other robots to complete a
              challenge.
              In September, teams worldwide are given a challenge that
              their robot must complete. The teams must use a set list
              of materials to build a robot to complete that challenge.

                    I've always loved engineering, and I currently base my entire life
                    around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team for 2 years,
                    I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams in the last two
                    years,
                    and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional teams this coming year. I also
                    build things on my free time, for myself and others. The amount of
                    time, money, and effort I have put into engineering is astronomical
                    compared to the time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest
                    drive to continue working towards my engineering goals is that
                    someday, I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community.
                    The feeling you get when you make something all by yourself, or
                    design something that works is the best feeling in the world, and
                    I want to share that with as many people as I can. When I was
                    younger, I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside
                    of arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities
                    that I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and
                    programming.

                    Hi, I'm Andrew of Team 310, Stuy Fission.
                    I like to swim, play
                    video games, work out puzzles, and hang out with friends. Ever
                    since I was little I've been surrounded by people who like to
                    work with their hands, and play with things like Lego. Maybe
                    that's a reason why now engineering interests me, and why I
                    want to learn more about it. On the team I hope to gain more
                    experience and have fun while also learning about design and
                    functionality. Building a competition-ready robot with my team
                    and seeing it succeed in many ways adds another page in my
                    book.

                    I loved playing with Lego and
                    KNex when I was younger, and still do love toying around
                    with them today. As I grew older, I became fascinated with
                    machines and engineering. In my middle school, there was
                    a club for robotics where we made different things with
                    Lego Mindstorms and learned the basics of engineering, but
                    we never got to a competitive level. I also want to become
                    an engineer when I grow up! All of these reasons are why I
                    chose to join Stuy Fission. Being on the team is a very fun
                    and educational experience!

                    Hello my name's Thomas Ly and
                    I'm a part of Team 310 of Stuyvesant Robotics. As I grew up
                    I was always fascinated by technology and the miracles it
                    could create. As a grew up I found myself wanting to interact
                    with technology and perhaps perform some miracles of my own. A
                    few years ago after reading a few articles about prosthetic
                    limb research I became interested in machinery and many uses
                    that came with it. So when I heard about a club in my high
                    school that focused primarily on building robots I joined in.
                    Now I hope to gain more experience regarding robotics and to
                    achieve great things with my team. Some things I like that
                    don't relate to Robotics are gaming, swimming, programming,
                    and reading.

                    I joined robotics because of an interest in computer programmers
                    as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the difficulties
                    that robotics would present. From a young age, I've been extremely
                    interested in the workings of computers and I enjoy tinkering with
                    code in my free time. I enjoy the logical challenges presented by
                    code and the engineering challenges presented by robotics. I have
                    experience with object oriented coding languages and web design
                    and I have interned at an education company as a programmer. My
                    other hobbies aside from robotics include playing basketball,
                    League of Legends, piano, and guitar. As head of programming for
                    Stuy Fission 310, I am tasked with website design and maintenance
                    as well as robot programming and delegating programmers to do the
                    same.

                    All my life, I've been surrounded
                    by computers and technology, but have never really been able
                    to learn about their inner workings. When I heard about the
                    Stuyvesant robotics team, I found it the perfect opportunity
                    to catch up on lost time, learn about engineering, and brush
                    up on programming. On the team, I am one of the main
                    programmers, and contributed to most of the WaffleBot code.
                    In my spare time,  I enjoy playing video games, reading
                    (mostly fiction), and playing the violin.

                    that knowledge instantly is incredible. Learning to code has
                    probably been the only time in my life that I have excited about
                    learning. Other than programming, I enjoy playing soccer, tennis,
                    and ping pong. I have my own math tutoring business, and I tutor
                    kids in middle school in math.

                    The first time I got involved with robotics was when I went to a
                    robotics camp at Johns Hopkins’ Center for Talented Youth with
                    Alvin. I fell in love with robotics and as soon as I returned home
                    from the camp, I bought my own Lego Mindstorms kit. In middle
                    school, Alvin and I joined the robotics team and ended up leading
                    the team. I also started to make my own money by selling, bracelets,
                    and rubik’s cubes to my classmates. Through that experience, I
                    learned to earn and manage my money. I hope to study at Harvard
                    business school. My combined experience in robotics and with money
                    led me to doing marketing for 310 Fission. My other interests
                    include chess, tennis, violin, basketball, and gaming.
