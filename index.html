              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FIRST Tech Challenge, or FTC,
              is a high school level competition created to inspire
              young minds around the world to design and build robots
              that will compete in different competitions.
              In September, teams worldwide pick up the game
              manual and start working. Given a set list of parts,
              teams are limited
              to using only certain materials for their robot, making
              the
              game harder and more challenging.

              I've always loved engineering, and I currently base my entire life
              around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team for 2 years,
              I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams in the last two
              years,
              and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional teams this coming year. I also
              build things on my free time, for myself and others. The amount of
              time, money, and effort I have put into engineering is astronomical
              compared to the time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest
              drive to continue working towards my engineering goals is that
              someday, I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community.
              The feeling you get when you make something all by yourself, or
              design something that works is the best feeling in the world, and
              I want to share that with as many people as I can. When I was
              younger, I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside
              of arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities
              that I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and
              programming.

              I joined robotics because of an interest in computer programming
              as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the difficulties
              that robotics would present. From a young age, I've been extremely
              interested in the workings of computers and I enjoy tinkering with
              code in my free time. I enjoy the logical challenges presented by
              code and the engineering challenges presented by robotics. I have
              experience with object oriented coding languages and web design
              and I have interned at an education company as a programmer. My
              other hobbies aside from robotics include playing basketball,
              League of Legends, piano, and guitar. As head of programming for
              Stuy Fission 310, I am tasked with website design and maintenance
              as well as robot programming and delegating programmers to do the
              same.

              The first time I got involved with robotics was when I went to a
              robotics camp at Johns Hopkins’ Center for Talented Youth with
              Alvin. I fell in love with robotics and as soon as I returned home
              from the camp, I bought my own Lego Mindstorms kit. In middle
              school, Alvin and I joined the robotics team and ended up leading
              the team. I also started to make my own money by selling, bracelets,
              and rubik’s cubes to my classmates. Through that experience, I
              learned to earn and manage my money. I hope to study at Harvard
              business school. My combined experience in robotics and with money
              led me to doing marketing for 310 Fission. My other interests
              include chess, tennis, violin, basketball, and gaming.
