                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've always loved engineering, and
                I currently base my entire
                life around it. Not only have I been a member of my FTC team
                for 2 years, I have also mentored a total of three FLL teams
                in the last two years, and I plan to mentor 2-3 additional
                teams this coming year. I also build things on my free time,
                for myself and others. The amount of time, money, and effort
                I have put into engineering is astronomical compared to the
                time I've spent doing anything else. My biggest drive to
                continue working towards my engineering goals is that someday,
                I wish to spread the ideals of STEM to my community. The feeling
                you get when you make something all by yourself,  or design
                something that works is the best feeling in the world, and I want
                to share that with as many people as I can. When I was younger,
                I didn't have many opportunities to make things outside of
                arts and crafts, so I want to give others the opportunities that
                I wish I had. My other interests include piano, tennis, and not
                much other stuff.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I joined robotics because of an
                interest in computer programming
                as a career and I wanted to challenge myself with the
                difficulties that robotics would present. From a young age,
                I've been extremely interested in the workings of computers and
                I enjoy tinkering with code in my free time. I enjoy the logical
                challenges presented by code and the engineering challenges
                presented by robotics. My other hobbies aside from robotics
                include playing basketball, League of Legends,
                piano, and guitar. As head of programming for Stuy Fission 310,
                I am tasked with web design as well as robot programming and
                delegating programmers to do the same.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, I'm Andrew of Team 310, Stuy Fission.
                I like to swim, play
                video games, work out puzzles, and hang out with friends. Ever
                since I was little I've been surrounded by people who like to
                work with their hands, and play with things like Lego. Maybe
                that's a reason why now engineering interests me, and why I
                want to learn more about it. On the team I hope to gain more
                experience and have fun while also learning about design and
                functionality. Building a competition-ready robot with my team
                and seeing it succeed in many ways adds another page in my
                book.
